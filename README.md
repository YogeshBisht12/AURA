## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Frontend | Backend | AI / APIs |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| React.js | Node.js + Express | Gemini API / OpenAI GPT |
| Tailwind CSS | MongoDB / JWT Auth | Web Speech API (TTS / STT) |
| React Router | CORS / Cookie Auth | Custom Prompt Engine |



🧑‍💻 How It Works
1) User says “Hey Aura” – Hotword detection starts listening.

2) Voice is converted to text using the Web Speech API.

3) Command is parsed and interpreted using your custom prompt + Gemini API.

4) Assistant responds via voice using TTS, and optionally performs actions (like opening a link).

I5) nteraction history is saved for personalization.
